            <p>Edward Elric, a young, brilliant alchemist, has lost much in his twelve-year life: when he and his
                brother Alphonse try to resurrect their dead mother through the forbidden act of human transmutation,
                Edward loses his brother as well as two of his limbs. With his supreme alchemy skills, Edward binds
                Alphonse's soul to a large suit of armor.</p>

            <img src="photos/fa/edward.webp">
            <p>After losing his right arm and left leg due to a failed Human Transmutation attempt, Ed became the
                youngest State Alchemist in history by achieving his certification at age twelve. Three years later, Ed
                has become fully engrossed in his search for the legendary Philosopher's Stone, an item with which he
                hopes to restore his younger brother Alphonse Elric, whose whole body had been lost in the aftermath of
                the human transmutation.</p>

            <img src="photos/fa/alphonse.webp">
            <p>Alphonse Elric, also known as Al, is the deuteragonist of the Fullmetal
                Alchemist series. He is the younger brother of the Fullmetal Alchemist Edward Elric. Al is also a victim
                of the failed Human Transmutation experiment in which Ed lost his right arm and left leg. Having had his
                entire physical being taken away from him in the aftermath of the tragedy, Alphonse exists solely as a
                soul alchemically bound to a large suit of steel armor. Now, Al travels with his brother in search of a
                legendary Philosopher's Stone, an item with the power to restore their bodies to normal.</p>
