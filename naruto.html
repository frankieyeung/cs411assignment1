            <img src="photos/naruto/naruto.webp">
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on
                the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
                After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while
                chasing his dream to become Hokage. In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he
                became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world,
                becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf. He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning
                the Fourth Shinobi
                World War, leading him to achieve his dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage.</p>

            <h4 class="is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-desktop title">Sasuke Uchiha</h4>
            <img src="photos/naruto/sasuke.webp">
            <p>Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan.
                After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge
                them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his
                rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his
                progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His
                years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and
                isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the
                truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and
                being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help
                protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage".</p>
