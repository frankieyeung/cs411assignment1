            <p>Wall-E is a waste-collector drone created by the Buy n Large corporation initially programmed to haul the
                garbage plaguing Earth in the distant future. Unexpectedly, his years of loneliness and never-ending
                work allowed him to gain a consciousness of his own, and a wish for something else in life to come. One
                day, his world is turned upside-down when he meets another robot from outer space.</p>

            <h4 class="is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-desktop title">Eve</h4>
            <img src="photos/walle/eve.webp">
            <p>When EVE is first seen in the movie, she is hostile and dedicated to her task, but she is willing to take
                time off her directive and discover new things. When meeting WALL-E, she is wary of him and wants him
                out of trouble in her territory, however she begins to warm up to him when learning about his curious
                personality. Once she sees how infatuated he was to her, she becomes more closer to him and makes it her
                top priority to protect him.</p>
