            <img src="photos/slamdunk/sakuragi.webp">
            <p>Hanamichi Sakuragi is the main protagonist of Slam Dunk, serving as Shohoku's power forward. At the
                beginning of the series, Sakuragi is a slacker, good for nothing other than fighting. He is the leader
                of the feared Sakuragi Legion, which consists of his four friends Mito, Noma, Ohkusu and Takamiya. After
                being rejected fifty times by girls during junior high school, Sakuragi meets and falls in love with
                Haruko Akagi, a basketball fangirl. This and Haruko's encouragement lead him to join the Shohoku
                basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he is not able to keep up with the rest of the team
                despite his outstanding height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability. He regards himself as a
                "genius" though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. Sakuragi's most recognizable trait is
                his red hair, though he later shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to a loss in the
                Interhigh Tournament against Kainan.</p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="is-size-6-mobile is-size-4-desktop title">Rukawa</h4>
            <img src="photos/slamdunk/rukawa.webp">
            <p>Kaede Rukawa is the small forward of the Shohoku team, and Hanamichi Sakuragi's rival. He is the polar
                opposite to Sakuragi â€” attractive to girls, skilled at basketball, and very cold and aloof, although he
                does share some traits with Sakuragi in that they are not academically inclined and are good fighters.
                Although he regards Sakuragi as an idiot and the two frequently get into conflicts, he seems to realize
                that Sakuragi can put his talents to better use. Takenori Akagi's younger sister, Haruko, has a crush on
                him,[ch. 2] though she does not confess it and he himself is completely unaware of her feelings.
                Rukawa's chief hobby outside basketball is sleeping, and he is usually seen asleep whenever he's not on
                the court because he spends his nights practicing further. Due to this, he is prone to falling asleep
                even while riding his bicycle. He has also been in his fair share of off-court fights, but can hold his
                own. Rukawa's goal is to be the best high school player in Japan, and he considers Sendoh of Ryonan to
                be his greatest rival. He is often referred to as the "super-rookie" and the "ace of Shohoku".</p>
